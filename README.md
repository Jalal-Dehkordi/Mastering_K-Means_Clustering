# Mastering_K-Means_Clustering
# Clustering
## Objectives
- After completing this lab you will be able to:

Use scikit-learn's K-Means Clustering to cluster data
Introduction
There are many models for clustering out there. In this notebook, we will be presenting the model that is considered one of the simplest models amongst them. Despite its simplicity, the K-means is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, it is especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from unlabeled data. In this notebook, you will learn how to use k-Means for customer segmentation.

Some real-world applications of k-means:

-  Customer segmentation
- Understand what the visitors of a website are trying to accomplish
 - Pattern recognition
- Machine learning
- Data compression
